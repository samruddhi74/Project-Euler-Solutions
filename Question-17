Pen-Paper solution :

sum from 1 to 9 = 36 
sum from 11 to 19 = 67 
sum pf 20,30..,90 = 46

so total sum upto 99 = 854 
This sum repeated 10 times s = 8540 
sum of "hundred and" phrase 99*9 times = 8910
sum of "n hundred" = 36*100 + 7*9 
last is 1000 = 11 

Total sum = 8910 + 8540 + 63 + 3600 + 11 = 21124
